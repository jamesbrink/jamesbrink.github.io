    <p>
      My days are filled with breaking and fixing infrastructure, constantly switching between
      Terraform, NixOS, and whatever shiny tech caught my ADHD brain's attention this week.
    </p>

    <p>
      When I'm not knee-deep in configuration files or brute-forcing my way through yet another
      learning curve, you might find me pointing cameras at the night sky. My astrophotography hobby
      lets me escape the digital chaos by... creating a different kind of chaos involving expensive
      equipment, sleep deprivation, and the constant disappointment of cloud cover appearing exactly
      when a celestial event peaks. Somehow capturing photons from millions of light-years away
      feels more straightforward than getting Kubernetes to behave consistently.
    </p>

    <p>
      I've been everything from a Director of Infrastructure to "that guy who fixed the server at 3
      AM because he wrote the broken code in the first place." My relationship with Linux is both my
      longest and most dysfunctional commitment.
    </p>

    <h2>What I bring to the table</h2>

    <p>After two decades in the trenches, I've developed a particular set of skills:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Technical leadership & architecture</strong> — I design systems that scale, mentor engineers
        who implement them, and still write code because I refuse to become one of those architects who
        only draws boxes
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Infrastructure modernization</strong> — Turning legacy monoliths into cloud-native systems
        without burning down the business. I've survived enough migrations to know where the bodies are
        buried
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>AI/LLM integration & automation</strong> — Building agentic workflows and AI tooling that
        actually work in production, not just impressive demos. Check out my MCP projects
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Developer experience & platform engineering</strong> — Making other engineers' lives easier
        through better tooling, CI/CD pipelines, and infrastructure that doesn't require a PhD to operate
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>NixOS & reproducible infrastructure</strong> — Converting "works on my machine" into "works
        everywhere, every time." Declarative systems are my happy place
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What I'm looking for</h2>

    <p>
      I'm interested in Staff or Principal Engineer roles where I can combine hands-on technical
      work with architectural influence. I thrive in environments that value:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Solving hard problems over building features nobody asked for</li>
      <li>Sustainable engineering over heroic firefighting</li>
      <li>Autonomy and trust over micromanagement</li>
      <li>Remote-first culture (I've been doing this since before it was cool)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>My less-serious superpowers include:</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>Making cloud infrastructure bend to my will (mostly)</li>
      <li>Turning caffeine directly into automation scripts</li>
      <li>Creating documentation that future me will completely ignore</li>
      <li>Converting complex systems into slightly less complex systems</li>
      <li>Explaining technical concepts while watching eyes glaze over</li>
      <li>
        Staying awake for 36 hours straight to photograph that "once in a lifetime" comet that ends
        up looking like a smudge
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      If you're looking for polished perfection, you're in the wrong place. But if you want honest
      insights from someone who's made every infrastructure mistake possible (and invented a few new
      ones), pull up a terminal and stick around.
    </p>

Recently I have been doing a lot of data visualizations using Gource ([http://gource.io/](http://gource.io/)). This is an awesome open source tool created to visualize source code repositories and their evolution over time. If you're not familiar with it, check it out and just do a quick search on YouTube for "Gource" and you will come across a handful of videos.

I had been getting a lot of requests recently to generate similar videos for various projects. Gource runs great when you run it interactively, but when combined with a tool like FFmpeg, you can quickly bring your machine to a crawl. This was a problem I was facing, and it was further compounded by the fact that I was creating 4K videos at 60fps on a dated MacBook Pro. Thus I set out to figure out how I could run this in the cloud, specifically an EC2 instance and free up my laptop from the constant abuse of encoding 4K videos.

A quick Google search turned up a handful of "headless" docker containers for Gource. Every one I found had 2 major issues for my use case.

1. Nearly all of them had a tendency to create either raw, or lossless videos consuming 100's of GB on disk.
2. Although they were all headless, they all still required a GPU to render the OpenGL.

It was obvious I needed to create my own container to get this accomplished. I was able to overcome the GPU issue by building the **Mesa3d llvmpipe** driver ([https://www.mesa3d.org/llvmpipe.html](https://www.mesa3d.org/llvmpipe.html)) combined with **Xvfb** which allows us to render OpenGL on the CPU. This is definitely a hit in performance, but solves the big issue of requiring a GPU. In addition to this, I use named pipes between my Gource process and FFmpeg, which alleviates the issue with the disk consumption.

What I finally ended up with was two Docker images, the first one I use as a base image, so anyone can easily extend off of it.

```bash
# Example of using the Envisaged Docker image
docker run -v /path/to/repo:/data jamesbrink/envisaged
```

The container is designed to be simple to use, and produces high-quality 4K videos at 60fps without requiring a GPU or consuming excessive disk space.

## Features

- CPU-based OpenGL rendering with Mesa3d llvmpipe
- Efficient video encoding with FFmpeg
- Minimal disk usage through named pipes
- Support for 4K resolution at 60fps
- Customizable visualization parameters

## Technical Details

The container uses several technologies working together:

- **Xvfb**: Virtual framebuffer for X server
- **Mesa3d llvmpipe**: Software-based OpenGL rendering
- **Gource**: Visualization engine
- **FFmpeg**: Video encoding
- **Named pipes**: For efficient data transfer between processes

## Example Output

The resulting videos are high quality and perfect for presentations or sharing on platforms like YouTube. The visualizations make it easy to see how projects evolve over time, who contributed what, and when changes were made.

## Conclusion

If you're interested in creating your own visualizations, you can find the Docker image on Docker Hub at [jamesbrink/envisaged](https://hub.docker.com/r/jamesbrink/envisaged/) and the source code on GitHub at [jamesbrink/docker-envisaged](https://github.com/jamesbrink/docker-envisaged).

This project has made it much easier to create high-quality visualizations without taxing my local machine, and I hope others find it useful as well.
